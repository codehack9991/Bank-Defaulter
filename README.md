# Bank-Defaulter

The aim of this data science based project is to find the probability of a person defaulting out of their payment (loans and/or interests).

## Input Trainig Data

We are provided with an excel sheet containing the full data of each person , which includes information like :
 - Loan ID
 - Due amount
 - Due Mortgage
 - Value
 - Reason 
 - Time
 - Past History
 - Criminal History
 - Defaulter or not
 
## Training Models and Algorithms

Like all other data science problems,my main approach to solve the problem was to start training the data for various types of algorithms, which inlcude:
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression
 - SVM(Support Vector Machines)
 - Ensemble Training
 - MLP (Multi-Layered Perceptron)
 - Random Forest

And then I checked the accuracy and ROC for each of the algorithsm and compared them.
